## Project Idea

**Problem Area:** Personal finance management / spending awareness  
**Proposed Product:** A lightweight personal finance tool that helps users track daily expenses, visualize spending patterns, and reflect on their financial habits monthly, instead of just recording transactions.

## 1. Problem Identification

Many students and early-career professionals struggle with managing their personal finances:
- they lack visibility into where their money is actually going,
- they don't regularly reflect on spending habits,
- or they find existing budgeting tools too complex to maintain consistently.

As a result, overspending goes unnoticed, savings goals are missed, and financial stress builds up, even though banking apps and spreadsheets already exist.

## 2. Mom Test Interviews

### Interview Setup

- **Number of interviews:** 3
- **Participants:** Students / early-career professionals
- **Method:** 1-on-1 video calls x 2, face-to-face meeting x 1
- **Goal:** Understand how people currently track and reflect on their personal spending

## 3. Interview Summaries

### Interview 1 — Graduate Student A

- The participant does not use any dedicated budgeting tool.
- They check their bank account balance occasionally but rarely review individual transactions.
- When asked about the _last time_ they overspent, they described a month where dining out expenses were much higher than expected, but they only realized it after the fact.
- They expressed interest in a simple way to see spending by category without setting up complex budgets.
- They also mentioned wishing they could write down why they overspent to avoid repeating the pattern.

**Key Insight:** Users want spending visibility without the overhead of traditional budgeting tools.

### Interview 2 — Software Developer at a Startup

- The participant tried using a spreadsheet to track expenses but abandoned it after two weeks.
- They described the process as tedious and said manual entry felt like a chore.
- When asked what would help, they said a quick input method with a visual summary would be enough.
- They also mentioned that they never look back at past months to compare spending trends.

**Key Insight:** Expense tracking tools need to be low-friction or users will abandon them quickly.

### Interview 3 — Undergraduate Student

- The participant manages money through mental math and checking their bank app.
- They described a situation where they ran out of their monthly allowance two weeks early because of untracked small purchases.
- When asked how they decide what to cut back on, they said they have no clear method.
- They expressed interest in seeing their top spending categories at a glance.

**Key Insight:** Users lack a simple way to identify and prioritize where to reduce spending.

## 4. User Stories

- As a graduate student, who has limited income, I want to log my daily expenses quickly, so that I can stay aware of where my money goes.
- As an undergraduate student, who receives a monthly allowance, I want to see my top spending categories, so that I can identify areas to cut back.
- As an early-career professional, who wants to build better financial habits, I want to write a monthly reflection on my spending, so that I can recognize patterns and make intentional changes.
- As an early-career professional, who earns a regular salary, I want to view charts of my spending over time, so that I can track whether I'm improving.
- As a general individual user, who tracks expenses on the go, I want a simple input interface, so that logging an expense takes minimal effort.
- As a general individual user, who wants to understand their finances better, I want to see insights based on my spending data, so that I can make more informed financial decisions.

## 5. Prioritization Using MoSCoW

### Must Have

- Ability to log expenses with category and amount
- Dashboard showing total spending and top categories  
    **Justification:**  
    Without these, the product does not solve the core problem of spending visibility identified in interviews.

### Should Have

- Spending charts and visual breakdowns
- Monthly reflection feature for journaling about spending habits  
    **Justification:**  
    These features significantly improve self-awareness and behavior change but are not required for a first version.

### Could Have

- Analytics on spending trends over multiple months
- Automated insights or suggestions based on spending patterns  
    **Justification:**  
    Nice-to-have features that enhance user understanding but increase complexity.

### Won't Have (for now)

- Bank account integration or automatic transaction import
- Shared household budgeting or team features  
    **Justification:**  
    Interview data focused on personal, manual expense awareness, not automated syncing or collaborative budgeting.
